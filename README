This is a project that translates English to Turkish and Turkish to English. Program takes input from the user and creates an output file.
As a input, the user is expected to give the language to be translated and the name of the file which contains the words to be translated,
as well as the name of the dictionary file to be used for translating purposes. Program takes the input file and searches the words one by one in the dictionary file.
If the meaning of the word is found, then the program writes the output file the meaning. But if dictionary file does not contains the meaning of the word, then
it writes the word itself in the output file. It also keeps a counter of the numbers for the succesfull translations and the unsuccesfull translations. When the program
ended it prints these counters in the screen. This project includes the libfdr library. Especially uses fields structure while readig the input file. Adds the results of
the translations to the double linked list by using dllist.h in the libfdr library. It also contains the makefile in order to run these files together. 

Example input:
$> bin/ceviri tr txt/input.txt txt/sozluk.txt 
takes the words inside of the input.txt file and translates the words in English to Turkish using the sozluk.txt file. 

$> bin/ceviri eng txt/input.txt txt/sozluk.txt 
takes the words inside of the input.txt file and translates the words in Turkish to English using the sozluk.txt file.
